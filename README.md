COVID-19 SQL Portfolio
Overview
Welcome to my COVID-19 SQL Portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL skills through the creation of structured databases containing real-life data related to various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These datasets include information on the number of infections, cases, vaccination ratios, and more, organized by country and continent. The aim of this project is to provide a valuable resource for data analysis and research on the ongoing global health crisis.

Datasets
This portfolio includes several datasets, each focusing on a specific aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic:

Infections by Country: A table containing data on the number of COVID-19 infections reported in different countries.

Cases by Country: This table provides information on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by country.

Vaccination Ratios: Explore the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations across countries, including vaccination rates and doses administered.

Continental Breakdown: A comprehensive dataset categorizing COVID-19 statistics by continent, allowing for regional analysis.

How to Use
You can use these datasets for various purposes, including data analysis, visualization, and research. Here's how to get started:
